Program rectplanet2 combines all of the ideas from the previous programs
(up to keyboard3D), and makes (slightly) more interesting use of transforms
to simulate a rectplanet2 circling a sun.  An additional feature is camera zoom,
which allows us to move back and forth along the line of sight.  Zooming out
far enough will cause the scene to slowly be clipped by the back of the
view volume.
