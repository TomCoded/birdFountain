Ideas for features to add:

Josh Ain:
randomizer - probably as part of mathematical expressions
camera motions

Steve:
autooverlappolygons - autocreate n objects spun by a certain amount
relative to each other for odd lighting effects; subset of for loops, perhaps.
Making new class addition to SceneFileReader easy.

Andrew:
Mouse actions trigger screen actions of some sort

Brent:
Light motions
vertex paths with bezier corners
for loops in scene files
colors based on sort-of greenish...

Me:
ability to toggle lighting sets for a scene
dynamic/runtime plugin system
#define(s) statements to trivialize new class addition to FileReader()
functions of > 1 variable
aliasing of words in scenefiles
user defined polygons
user defined regular polygons (e.g. regpoly numfaces)
if() nodeGLs
Mouse actions to move some objects (inspired from Andrew)
Ability to randomize material properties/colors
Ability to define input Scenefile language and re-write in terms of
one or another such languages.
Scenefile optimizer to minimize computation / stack depth
NodeGLs that store the current matrix when created so that they can
simply dump it on the stack when it's their turn through.
Fix function parser.  Add support for:
   - multiple variables
   - leading minus sign
   - starting with parenthesized expression
   - logarithms
   - user-defined functions
user defined nodes as a function of one or more variables

Anonymous1:
Camera automated flythroughs
texture mapping
Frenet frame camera motions

misc:
object transparencies
